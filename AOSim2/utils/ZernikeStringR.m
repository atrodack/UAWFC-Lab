function [s,dx,dy] = ZernikeStringR(n,f)
%<PRE>
%ZernikeStringR  Generate string definitions of Zernike's circle polynomials  
%  and also their partial derivatives in rectangular form.
%
% Use: [s,dx,dy] = ZernikeStringR(n,f)
%
% NOTE: UNLIKE MALACARA, WE ADOPT THE MATHEMATICAL CONVENTION OF X-AXIS AS 
% REFERENCE MERIDIAN FOR SPECIFYING ANGLES.  i.e. we adopt the convention
%  x=r*cos(theta), y=r*sin(theta). This is achieved by exchanging X & Y 
% in Malacara's eqn. A2.17 (1978) ar eqn. 13.40 (1992)
%
% Output matrices: 	s is the Zernike equation
%					dx is its partial derivatives in x, 
%					dy is its partial derivative in y.
%
% Input args: 	n = radial "degree" or "order", [a positive integer]
%  			 	f = azimuthal frequency, [a signed integer, magnitude <= n]
%
% Method:  implement eqn. A2.17 from "Optical Shop Testing" (1978) by Malacara.
%			which is meant to be the same as eqn. 13.40 in 2nd edition (1992).
% 	IMPORTANT NOTE: there are errors in both editions of Malacara's book!
% 	1978 edition has an error in Table A2.2, case n=4,m=-2 which is corrected 
%	  in 1992.
%	1978 edition has errors in the bottom row of table A2.3 which are corrected
%	  in 1992.
% 	1992 version of Table 13.3 introduced an error for the case of n=even, 
%		(i.e. sine term).  Refer to 1978 version for correct formula.
%	1992 eqn. 13.40 has an equals sign on the second line which should be
%		 multiplication sign. Refer to 1978 version for correct formula.
%	1992 edition contains a critical phrase on p. 471 that is missing from 1978.
%		"where m must be replaced by n-m when n-2m =<0".  This is the key to 
%		handling negative azimuthal frequencies.  However, the statement only 
%		refers to the limits of summation, and one binomial term, but not to 
%		the other terms in the formula. Also, the sign of frequency must be 
%		reversed when f<0.
%
% 	Two solutions are required: one for positive azimuthal frequency, another 
% 	for negative. Malacara's text is very confusing on this point. He says on
% 	p. 471 of 1992 edition to replace m with n-m in summation formula. By trial
% 	& error, I determined that this should only be done for summantion limits, 
% 	and for just one of the algebraic terms. I also figured the absolute value 
%	of frequency needed to be used to get binomial coeff. I presume these are  
%	all typographical errors in the printed book since Malacara's tables of
%	functions in polar and cartesian forms are in agreement with each other.
% 	This MATLAB routine generates formulas that match Malacara's published tables.
%
% Verification: compare output with Malacara's Table A2.2 (1978) and 13.2 (1992).
%	Note that this program sometimes produces terms of the same order which may  
%	be combined manually prior to comparing results with Malacara's tables.  
% 	See test routine MALACARA_VS_AUTO for the method used to compare output 
%	of this routine with published table of Malacara (1992).  Extrapolation 
%	to orders > 20 needs careful testing.  It isn't obvious that coefficients for 
%	higher orders will be correctly computed by routines FACTORIAL and BINCOEFF.
%
% Background:
%	In polar form, a wavefront is represented by a sum of Zernike modes 
%	of the form:
%	 R[superscript_f, subscript_n] * ( C[n,f]*cos(f*theta) + D[n,f]*sin(f*theta) )
%	(this is eqn. A2.8 of Malacara (1978) or eqn. 13.22 of Malacara (1992)).
%
%	Amazingly, this polar equation can be converted to rectangular form without 
%	recourse to brute-force transformation eqns. x=rcos(q), y=rsin(q) plus the
%	 repeated use of trig identities to unpack the harmonic trig terms.  
%	The key is eqn. A2.14 (1978) or eqn. 13.37 (1992) which gives power series 
%	representation of cos(n*theta) and sin(n*theta) in rectangular form.  
%	(NOTE: there is a typographcial error in both of these eqns.: in the 
%	binomial coefficient, 2i+p should be 2j+p.)  According to eqn. A2.17, 
%	the un-normalized Zernike circle polynomials in monomial (i.e.rectangular) 
%	form is given by a triple sum over indices i,j,k which determine the values 
%	of the coefficients of each term in the polynomial, as well as the powers 
%	of x,y.  (Note: the corresponding eqn. 13.40 (1992) has a typographical error:
%	the equals sign ("=") in the last line should be a multiplication sign ("*").)
%
% 	Implementation of Malacara's eqn. A2.17 requires careful attention to detail in 
% 	handling the 4 cases of even & odd order, sine and cosine terms.
%
% Terms:	n = radial "degree" or "order" of the polynomial 
%			f = azimuthal frequency (Note: Malacara uses letter l in his eqns., 
%				which invites confusion).
%			m = (n-f)/2 = a convenient combination of n,f used by Malacara
%
% Required subroutines: functions FACTORIAL and BINCOEFF by LNT.
