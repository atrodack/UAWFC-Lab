function PS = make(PS,L0,fixLF)

% MAKE: Synthesize a new random phase screen.
%
% PS = make(PS,L0,fixLF)
%
% Renders a Kolmogorov AOPhaseScreen.
%
% INPUTS:
% PS: An AOPhaseScreen object.  You need to have set r0 (Fried's length)
%     before calling this routine.
% L0:    An Outer scale. (default is 30m)
% fixLF: If non-zero, patch up the low spatial-frequencies so that the
%        structure function behaves over a larger range.  (currently
%        doesn't do anything.)

% Written by: Johanan L. Codona, Steward Observatory CAAO
% June 25, 2002: First tests.
% July 12, 2002: Reworked for the AO classes.
% Feb. 25, 2003: Took care of high spatial frequency filtering.
% 20090413 JLCodona: AOSim2.
% Merged rewrite into the git repository for regression testing.
